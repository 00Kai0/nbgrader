nbgrader feedstock
==================

The conda recipe has been moved to a seperate repository ("feedstock") and now
publishes ``nbgrader`` to the ``conda-forge`` channel. If you wish to
contribute and/or improve the nbgrader recipe please see the
`nbgrader-feedstock <https://github.com/conda-forge/nbgrader-feedstock>`__ for
more details.
