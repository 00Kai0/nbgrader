The philosophy and the approach
===============================

The `nbgrader` project evolved from my experiences as an instructor and a
student. This `excerpt from David Marr's book, Vision,
<http://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209a/ReadingsByDate/01_07/Marr82Philosophy.pdf>`_ 
inspired the creation of `nbgrader`. Dr. Marr was an originator of the field
of computational neuroscience. On behalf of the many individuals who
contribute to `nbgrader`, I hope you find this project enhances your teaching
and learning experiences.
