A system for assigning and grading notebooks.

**Warning: nbgrader is not yet stable and is under active development. The following instructions are currently incomplete and may change!**

Additional note: nbgrader depends on the master development version of IPython (currently 3.0.0). It will probably not work with older versions of IPython (even the most recent release).
